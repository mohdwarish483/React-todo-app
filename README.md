# React Todo App by Mohd Warish

## About Project

I have successfully developed a Todo App using React, incorporating essential functionalities like task creation, editing, and deletion. Additionally, users can view completed tasks and sort them by alphabetical order, priority, or recency. To enhance user experience, I've implemented themes, offering both light and dark options. This app provides an intuitive and efficient task management solution.
